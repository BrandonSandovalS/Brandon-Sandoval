This will be my code for the Creative Project and also the execution file. 
If you want to get the file so you can use it:
    1. Click on the .exe file
    2. Click on Download
    3. Click on the upward arrow (^) if it says discard.
    4. Click on keep.
    5. Click on the .exe file to run
    6. Click on more info then on run anyway
    7. My program should then run.
